# PatchyGBA
A wrapper for HackMew's thumb.dat that allows you to automatically assemble and patch a ROM directly with the .org command.

**Download:** [patchy.jar](https://github.com/TheGag96/PatchyGBA/raw/master/bin/patchy.jar)

Place it in the same directory as HackMew's [thumb.dat](http://www.pokecommunity.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=50365&d=1255215450) (need a PokeCommunity account to download). Run it with "java -jar patchy.jar" or "java -jar patchy.jar [patch file] [rom file]".

Have fun! :D
